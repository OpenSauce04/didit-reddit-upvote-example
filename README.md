## Stretch goals

- [ ] Fix page titles on post pages to match the post title
- [x] Handle the error when you click to vote while not logged in to show a nice error message
- [ ] Try to make it so I can’t vote more than once (Fix could be done in the SQL with the constraints  (ideally), or in-app code to check the db before adding a new row to the votes table)
- [ ] Users would like a richer editing experience we’d like to incorporate TipTap (based on Prosemirror)
- [ ] Users can vote an infinite number of times on the same post. We’d like to prevent this happening. It should be enforced at the Schema level with the UNIQUE constraint but it isn’t working. We’d like you to try and fix this, either by correcting the schema (preferable) or if not by implementing the restriction in the application code when the user tries to upvote.

## Potential future features

- [ ] User profiles
- [ ] Sorting posts by recent (date posted), top (most upvotes), and most controversial (most upvotes _and_ downvotes)
- [ ] User karma scores
- [ ] User badges / trophies (awards for achievements like number of posts, years on the site, etc.)
- [ ] User settings (eg. number of posts per page, theme, etc.)
- [ ] Moderation tools / reporting or flagging objectionable comments for removable by admins
- [ ] Searching posts (possibly using simple SQL LIKE '%some search%', or [Postgres text search](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/postgres-full-text-search-a-search-engine-in-a-database))
- [ ] Subreddits (separate communities, that isn't just one big list of posts, that can be created by users)
- [ ] User notifications
- [ ] User private messaging
- [ ] User blocking
- [ ] User following
- [ ] User feed (posts from users you follow)
- [ ] User flair
